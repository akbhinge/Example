Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. When you initialize a repository, the directory is set to be the git directory. Git status lets us know of any untracked files waiting to be added to the repository.

Q. How is staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value does it offer?

A. It allows us to commit more than one files at once when there is sufficient change to commit. It acts as an additional layer between working directory and repository.
